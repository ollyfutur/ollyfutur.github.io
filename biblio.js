      "title": "Binding site plasticity regulation of the FimH catch-bond mechanism",
      "abstractNote": "The bacterial ﬁmbrial adhesin FimH is a remarkable and well-studied catch-bond protein found at the tip of E. coli type 1 pili, which allows pathogenic strains involved in urinary tract infections to bind high-mannose glycans exposed on human epithelia. The catch-bond behavior of FimH, where the strength of the interaction increases when a force is applied to separate the two partners, enables the bacteria to resist clearance when they are subjected to shear forces induced by urine ﬂow. Two decades of experimental studies performed at the single-molecule level, as well as x-ray crystallography and modeling studies, have led to a consensus picture whereby force separates the binding domain from an inhibitor domain, effectively triggering an allosteric conformational change in the former. This force-induced allostery is thought to be responsible for an increased binding afﬁnity at the core of the catch-bond mechanism. However, some important questions remain, the most challenging one being that the crystal structures corresponding to these two allosteric states show almost superimposable binding site geometries, which questions the molecular origin for the large difference in afﬁnity. Using molecular dynamics with a combination of enhanced-sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the static picture provided by the crystal structures conceals a variety of binding site conformations that have a key impact on the apparent afﬁnity. Crucially, the respective populations in each of these conformations are very different between the two allosteric states of the binding domain, which can then be related to experimental afﬁnity measurements. We also evidence a previously unappreciated but important effect: in addition to the well-established role of the force as an allosteric regulator via domain separation, application of force tends to directly favor the high-afﬁnity binding site conformations. We hypothesize that this additional ‘‘local’’ catch-bond effect could delay unbinding between the bacteria and the host cell before the ‘‘global’’ allosteric transition occurs, as well as stabilizing the complex even more once in the high-afﬁnity allosteric state.",

      "title": "Exposure of Von Willebrand Factor Cleavage Site in A1A2A3-Fragment under Extreme Hydrodynamic Shear",
      "abstractNote": "Von Willebrand Factor (vWf) is a giant multimeric extracellular blood plasma involved in hemostasis. In this work we present multi-scale simulations of its three-domains fragment A1A2A3. These three domains are essential for the functional regulation of vWf. Namely the A2 domain hosts the site where the protease ADAMTS13 cleavages the multimeric vWf allowing for its length control that prevents thrombotic conditions. The exposure of the cleavage site follows the elongation/unfolding of the domain that is caused by an increased shear stress in blood. By deploying Lattice Boltzmann molecular dynamics simulations based on the OPEP coarse-grained model for proteins, we investigated at molecular level the unfolding of the A2 domain under the action of a perturbing shear flow. We described the structural steps of this unfolding that mainly concerns the β-strand structures of the domain, and we compared the process occurring under shear with that produced by the action of a directional pulling force, a typical condition of single molecule experiments. We observe, that under the action of shear flow, the competition among the elongational and rotational components of the fluid field leads to a complex behaviour of the domain, where elongated structures can be followed by partially collapsed melted globule structures with a very different degree of exposure of the cleavage site. Our simulations pose the base for the development of a multi-scale in-silico description of vWf dynamics and functionality in physiological conditions, including high resolution details for molecular relevant events, e.g., the binding to platelets and collagen during coagulation or thrombosis.",

      "title": "Three Weaknesses for Three Perturbations: Comparing Protein Unfolding Under Shear, Force, and Thermal Stresses",
      "abstractNote": "The perturbation of a protein conformation by a physiological ﬂuid ﬂow is crucial in various biological processes including blood clotting and bacterial adhesion to human tissues. Investigating such mechanisms by computer simulations is thus of great interest, but it requires development of ad hoc strategies to mimic the complex hydrodynamic interactions acting on the protein from the surrounding ﬂow. In this study, we apply the Lattice Boltzmann Molecular Dynamics (LBMD) technique built on the implicit solvent coarse-grained model for protein Optimized Potential for Eﬃcient peptide structure Prediction (OPEP) and a mesoscopic representation of the ﬂuid solvent, to simulate the unfolding of a small globular cold-shock protein in shear ﬂow and to compare it to the unfolding mechanisms caused either by mechanical or thermal perturbations. We show that each perturbation probes a speciﬁc weakness of the protein and causes the disruption of the native fold along diﬀerent unfolding pathways. Notably, the shear ﬂow and the thermal unfolding exhibit very similar pathways, while because of the directionality of the perturbation, the unfolding under force is quite diﬀerent. For force and thermal disruption of the native state, the coarse-grained simulations are compared to all-atom simulations in explicit solvent, showing an excellent agreement in the explored unfolding mechanisms. These ﬁndings encourage the use of LBMD based on the OPEP model to investigate how a ﬂow can aﬀect the function of larger proteins, for example, in catch-bond systems.",
